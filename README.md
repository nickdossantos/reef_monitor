Reef Monitor

Reef Monitor is a IOT Application geared towards making reef keeping easier.

Rails follows the MVC development design pattern. Inside the APP directory is where you will find all MVC directories such as Models, Views, and Controllers. Models holds data model classes and model associations. Views consists of HTML.erb and JS.erb files that are rendered upon navigation through the application. Controllers handles all logic of the application. When a user makes a request the controller handles that request and responds accordingly. 

Inside the APP directory you will also find a directory called Services. Services is a directory that is dedicated for Service Object's. Service objects help take logic out of controllers. Services objects contain code very nicely.

The Config directory consists is where app specific files live. You can find the routes file that stores all routes of the application. 

DB directory is where you can find the Schema and previous database migrations.
